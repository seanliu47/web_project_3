                  home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super
                  sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition.

                  the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its

                  best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly
                  hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in
                  Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to
                  keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may

                  Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,”
                  although it can be from time to time, is another town worth

                  The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't

                  chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most
                  likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on

                  America, over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude of
                  2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only
                  thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the
                  country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting
                  to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be
                  one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete
